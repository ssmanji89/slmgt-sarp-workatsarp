# GitHub Workflows

This directory is intentionally kept empty.

The website is a simple static HTML/CSS/JS site that doesn't require any build processes or Node.js dependencies. GitHub Pages will automatically deploy the site without needing any additional workflows.

If you need to add custom workflows in the future, you can place them in this directory.
