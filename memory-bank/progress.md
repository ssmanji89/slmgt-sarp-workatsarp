# Progress

## Milestones

- Architectural Plan: Defined initial project architecture.
- Responsive Components: Established responsive layout with CSS using clamp() and media queries.
- Asynchronous Data Processing: Implemented initial fetch-based asynchronous functions with robust error handling.
- Form Submission: Developed a prototype for asynchronous form submission with error notifications.
- Modular Architecture: Separated concerns into dedicated files (app.js, styles.css, sw.js).
- Enhanced Error Handling: Implemented comprehensive error tracking and retry mechanisms.
- Analytics Integration: Added detailed performance and user interaction tracking.
- Offline Capabilities: Implemented service worker with cache-first strategy and background sync.
- Testing Infrastructure: Implemented comprehensive unit tests with Jest and JSDOM.
- Test Coverage: Achieved high test coverage across all metrics (>90% for most metrics).
- Offline Experience: Implemented custom offline page with cached content access and reconnection handling.
