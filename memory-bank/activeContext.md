## Active Decisions

### Design Approach
We are implementing a design that aligns with the existing ZG Companies branding, focusing on a professional and modern aesthetic suitable for commercial real estate marketing. The design will be responsive and mobile-friendly, with a focus on showcasing the property effectively.

### Content Strategy
Content will be organized around the key selling points of the property, with a focus on:
1. Visual presentation of the property
2. Detailed information about available spaces
3. Location advantages and amenities
4. Clear contact and inquiry options

### Technical Implementation
We are using static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for:
1. Simplicity and ease of implementation
2. Fast loading times
3. Compatibility with GitHub Pages hosting
4. Flexibility for future enhancements

### Integration Considerations
For form handling and dynamic elements, we are implementing:
1. Third-party form processing compatible with Microsoft ecosystem
2. Interactive maps for location information
3. Image galleries for property showcase
4. Analytics for visitor tracking

## Current Challenges

### Content Availability
- Floor plans are noted as "Coming Soon" and will need to be integrated when available
- High-quality property images need to be sourced or created
- Detailed property specifications may need to be gathered

### Technical Limitations
- GitHub Pages restrictions on server-side processing
- Need for third-party services for form handling
- Balancing performance with visual richness

### Timeline Considerations
- Need to establish core site structure quickly
- Prioritizing essential pages and functionality
- Planning for future content updates as more property information becomes available

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. Deploy the website to GitHub Pages
2. Set up the custom domain (www.workatsarp.com)
3. Test the website across different browsers and devices
4. Optimize performance and accessibility
5. Prepare documentation for content updates

### Short-Term Goals
1. Integrate with actual property images when available
2. Add floor plans when they become available
3. Implement Google Maps API for interactive location maps
4. Set up form submission integration with Microsoft ecosystem
5. Implement analytics tracking

### Medium-Term Objectives
1. Expand content with property updates and news
2. Implement additional interactive features
3. Optimize for search engine ranking
4. Gather and showcase tenant testimonials
5. Develop a content update strategy for ongoing maintenance
